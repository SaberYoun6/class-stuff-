* veracity     is the data accurate of does it have missing data points
* **vareity**  refers to the diversity of data 
* **velocity** how fast the data is coming

Distributed system challenges
* failure handling - add to one system that might leave incompelete data
## SDLC Software Development Life Cycle
# SDLC
* general process followed for software development 
Methodologies
* **Agile** is prefered method of programming its works like the scientific process in refining the details in sprints 
* waterfall it works in a downstream method in which if a team meets a hick-up they other team will be behind
* big bang it's a method in one design spagetti code and puts it out 
#Frameworks
specific implementation in which help the methodologies develop
Scrum 
kanban 
extreme programming
scrum-ban 

# Story points & hours 
* **story points** are used to determine how difficult a task is and how to prioritize the users cases 
#velocity 
the time it takes to complete the tasks
* how many story points you complete in a sprint to make the saga go down and become less of any epic
